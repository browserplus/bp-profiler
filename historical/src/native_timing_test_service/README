Building Instructions:

Currently the Makefile is designed for OSX, but the build should be
straightforward to port to win32.  This service is just a test to
understand roundtrip times in the system.

building:

1. make
2. [path_to_bpsdk]/bin/ServiceInstaller -v TimingTest
3. then ensure BrowserPlus 2.1.14 or greater is installed
4. open ../../tests/timing_test.htm in a browser

This is what I see on FFX 3/leopard (with firebug enabled):

Time offset from onload to initialized browserplus: 79ms
Time offset from init browserplus to require complete: 90ms
Time offset when first startedCallback received: 94ms
Time when first youGotTime call received: 95ms
Time offset when second startedCallback received: 98ms
Time when second youGotTime call received: 99ms 

This is what I see on Safari/leopard:

Time offset from onload to initialized browserplus: 16ms
Time offset from init browserplus to require complete: 21ms
Time offset when first startedCallback received: 23ms
Time when first youGotTime call received: 24ms
Time offset when second startedCallback received: 25ms
Time when second youGotTime call received: 25ms

(Tests on a newish macbook pro)

Conclusion?  A native service should give us about ~5ms correlation
between browser based javascript and profiling data acquired from
BrowserPlus loading a native service... Way dependent on os, system
speed, and what you got running in yer browser.  but good.
